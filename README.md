# draw2iupac

Work In Progress

Takes pictures of hand drawn molecules, applies computer vision (OpenCV) and deep learning (PyTorch) algorithms
to recognise the structural formula, and gives back the IUPAC name.

# About to be improved to use a convolutionary neural network for the letters recognition.
